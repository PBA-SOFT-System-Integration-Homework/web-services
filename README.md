# Team Wing it
This project dislays a very simple Car rental company that can consume cars from two different web services.
One SOAP server and one REST server where both expose relevant car data.

We've made a client that fetches data from the two servers, assemples it, and prints it to the log.

We've made the REST server in Java, SOAP server in NodeJA and client in node aswell.
