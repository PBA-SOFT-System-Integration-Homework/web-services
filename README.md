Team Wing it

We have made an amazing web service setup.

It consists of one SOAP server and one REST server where both expose data.

We've made a client that fetches data from the two servers, assemples it, and prints it to the log.

We've made the REST server in Java, SOAP server in Node and client in node aswell.

bada bing bada bum.
